//! Every generated `fjo raw` operation, composed into a request and checked against the
//! metadata it was generated from.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! `cli.rs` proves all 506 operations *build* a clap tree and render help. That catches the
//! crash-shaped failures (a duplicate long name is a clap `panic!`) and nothing else: a command
//! can build perfectly, parse perfectly, and still send `?per-page=50` instead of `?limit=50`,
//! or `contents/src%2Fmain.rs` instead of `contents/src/main.rs`. Those are silent wrong-request
//! bugs, they arrive with a **specification bump** rather than with a code change, and no amount
//! of `--help` rendering sees them.
//!
//! So this file goes one layer further: for each operation it synthesises an invocation from
//! that operation's own `OpMeta`, parses it through the real command tree, binds it, and asserts
//! the composed request is the one the metadata describes — method, rendered path, per-parameter
//! encoding, query keys, body JSON types, content type.
//!
//! # Why it can afford to do that 506 times
//!
//! [`fjo_raw::bind`] is pure: `ArgMatches` in, `PlannedRequest` out, no socket, no filesystem,
//! no subprocess. The whole loop is string work, which is what makes exhaustive coverage cost
//! milliseconds instead of a container per operation.
//!
//! # Why the values are ugly
//!
//! Every synthesised value names where it came from — `p0-owner/s`, `v-labels-2`,
//! `{"sentinel":"config"}`. A test that passes `"v"` for everything cannot tell a value that
//! landed in the right slot from one that landed in the wrong slot and happened to match. These
//! sentinels make cross-wiring visible in the failure message.
//!
//! Path values deliberately contain a `/`, because that single character is the difference
//! between the two encoding rules and the 404 that motivated them: a `Segment` parameter must
//! come out `%2F`, a `PathLike` parameter must keep the slash. Carrying a `/` in every path
//! value means all 947 path parameters exercise their own rule rather than only the ten that
//! are `PathLike`.
//!
//! # No silent skips
//!
//! An operation that cannot be synthesised is a **failure** listing the operation, not a
//! `continue`. [`UNSYNTHESIZABLE`] is the escape hatch, and it is a reviewed constant with a
//! reason per entry — an entry that is no longer needed fails the test too, so the list cannot
//! rot into a permanent exemption.
