//! `fjo pr create` — including AGit, the thing `gh` structurally cannot do.
//!
//! # AGit
//!
//! Every forge in the GitHub lineage requires a *branch* to open a pull request from, and — if you
//! cannot push to the repository — a *fork* to put that branch in. Forgejo also accepts pull
//! requests over **AGit**, which needs neither. You push your commits to a magic ref:
//!
//! ```text
//! git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main/my-topic
//! ```
//!
//! and the server creates a pull request against `main` from those commits. Nothing is added to the
//! repository's branch namespace, no fork exists, and a contributor with no write access can do it
//! against a repository that allows it. `git push` is the entire protocol, which is why this is
//! structural rather than a feature `gh` merely lacks: there is no GitHub API call that would do it.
//!
//! Three rules the implementation has to respect, because Forgejo enforces them:
//!
//! 1. **A topic is mandatory.** `refs/for/<base>` with no topic is refused. `fjo` defaults the
//!    topic to the current branch's name, which is both memorable and stable — and stability is what
//!    matters, because…
//! 2. **Updating means pushing the same topic again.** A different topic opens a *second* pull
//!    request. This is why the default is the branch name rather than, say, a timestamp.
//! 3. **An amended or rebased history needs `--force-push`,** since the update must otherwise be a
//!    fast-forward. That is the same rule as any other push, arriving in a place people do not
//!    expect it.
//!
//! Reference: <https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support/>.
//!
//! The push itself — the refspec, the push options, and the advice a refusal carries — lives in
//! [`forgejo_core::context::git::agit`], because `git push` *is* the protocol and there is no API
//! call to pair it with. This module supplies the title, the body and the topic, and reads back
//! the pull request the server says it created.
//!
//! ## Where a refusal is printed
//!
//! [`forgejo_core::context::git::GitCtx::push_agit`] folds git's stderr into the error it returns
//! rather than letting this module `eprint!` it first. That is a deliberate choice between the two
//! shapes `push_agit`'s own documentation offers, and the reason is redaction: a remote URL can
//! carry an embedded credential, git repeats that URL verbatim in a push failure, and only
//! `forgejo-core` can scrub it. Echoing the raw stderr here and *then* erroring would publish a
//! token into whatever the user pastes into a bug report. Nothing is lost — the error carries
//! every line git said, under `git says:` — and the successful path still relays git's stderr as
//! it arrives, which is where Forgejo's `remote:` lines with the pull request URL show up.
//!
//! # `--recover`
//!
//! A `create` that fails after the user wrote three paragraphs in `$EDITOR` has destroyed work. So
//! the title and body are written to a recovery file *before* the request goes out, the failure
//! message names it, and `--recover` replays it. Small feature; it is the difference between
//! shrugging and swearing.
