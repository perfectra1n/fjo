//! The `client` emitter: [`Ir::operations`] → `crates/forgejo-client/src/generated/{ops,query}/**`.
//!
//! # Every generated `fn` is concrete. No generics, anywhere, ever.
//!
//! This is the rule the whole emitter is organised around, and it is a compile-time budget
//! decision rather than a style preference. There are 506 operations. A single generic parameter
//! — `body: &impl Serialize`, or a `T: DeserializeOwned` return — monomorphises per operation
//! *and* per call site, so the cost of 42k generated lines stops being linear in the line count
//! and starts being linear in how much code uses it. `fjo` alone would instantiate the same
//! machinery hundreds of times.
//!
//! So every polymorphic thing lives in hand-written `forgejo-core`: `Client::json` is generic,
//! `create_pull_request` is not. Concretely, that means:
//!
//! - Request bodies are `&forgejo_model::CreatePullRequestOption`, never `impl Serialize`.
//! - Responses are named types; the generic `Client::json::<T>` call is the only turbofish.
//! - A streamed body is `ByteStream` (a boxed trait object) and a paginated one is `ItemStream<T>`
//!   — both concrete, so they can appear in a published signature without an `impl Trait` that
//!   leaks an unnameable type.
//! - `<Op>Query` builders take `&str`, not `impl Into<String>`, for exactly the same reason.
//!
//! # Method shape
//!
//! ```text
//! impl Repo<'_> {
//!     pub async fn create_pull_request(
//!         &self, owner: &str, repo: &str, body: &forgejo_model::CreatePullRequestOption,
//!     ) -> Result<forgejo_model::PullRequest> { … }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Path parameters are positional, **in path order** — that order is public API, so it comes from
//! [`crate::ir::paths::PathTemplate`] and not from the spec's parameter array. Query parameters
//! always collapse into one generated `<OpPascal>Query` struct, even when there is only one of
//! them: several operations take more than a dozen, and an arity cliff where some operations take
//! their filters as arguments and others take a struct would be worse than either rule alone.
//!
//! Paginated operations that return a bare JSON array get **two** methods: `list_x` returning an
//! `ItemStream`, and `list_x_page` returning one page plus its `PageInfo`, for callers who need
//! `x-total-count` or want to drive pagination themselves.
//!
//! # What this emitter is not allowed to decide
//!
//! Names come from [`crate::ir::names`], types from [`crate::ir::types`], path tokenization from
//! [`crate::ir::paths`], and doc text from [`crate::ir::doc`]. This module contains no string
//! casing, no `$ref` resolution, and no `overrides.toml`. Where a decision *looks* like it is
//! made here — which `Client` exit an operation uses, which `Accept` it sends — it is a pure
//! function of `Operation::success` and `Operation::produces`, and it fails loudly rather than
//! falling back, because a silent fallback to JSON on a `zip` endpoint hands the user a
//! `Result<Value>` that can never succeed.
