//! `overrides.toml` — the only place a human gets to disagree with the spec.
//!
//! Every naming and typing decision the generator makes is mechanical, and mechanical rules
//! occasionally produce something inhumane (`get-o-auth2-application`) or something the spec
//! simply does not contain (the variants of a bare Go `string` type). This file is where those
//! get corrected, and it is deliberately the *only* such place:
//!
//! - **Emitters may not read it.** Overrides are applied during lowering, so the IR is the
//!   single thing emitters see. An emitter that consulted overrides could disagree with
//!   another emitter about the same name, which is precisely the class of bug this project
//!   cannot afford across 42k lines.
//! - **Overrides are data, not code.** It is `include_str!`d, so the generator has no runtime
//!   file lookup and cannot behave differently depending on where it was invoked.
//! - **Nothing here disambiguates automatically.** A name collision is a hard error that names
//!   the exact entry to add. Silent auto-disambiguation would let a spec bump quietly rename a
//!   command that users have in scripts.
