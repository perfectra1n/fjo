//! `xtask` — the fjo generator and repository tooling.
//!
//! Never a dependency of the binary. Everything here runs on a developer's machine or in CI,
//! which is why it is allowed to shell out to `curl` instead of pulling an HTTP stack into the
//! workspace.
//!
//! The pipeline this crate implements, in order:
//!
//! ```text
//! upstream v1_json.tmpl ──update-spec──> spec/forgejo-vX.json ──lower──> Ir ──emit──> code
//!                                             + spec/lock.toml              + spec/name-lock.toml
//! ```
//!
//! Two invariants make the rest of the project safe to build on:
//!
//! 1. **`spec-stats --verify` is a self-test of the loader**, not a report. Its expected
//!    numbers were established by independent inspection of the spec. If the loader
//!    disagrees, the loader is wrong — and finding that out here is far cheaper than finding
//!    it out after 42k lines of generated code have been shaped by a miscount.
//! 2. **`spec/name-lock.toml` makes every command name a versioned contract.** A spec bump
//!    that would rename a command is a hard error until a human passes `--accept-renames`,
//!    because the alternative is silently breaking every script our users have written.
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// The IR is a contract that the four emitters (M4–M6) consume, so its fields necessarily
// exist before their readers do. The alternative — per-field `allow(dead_code)` removed one
// at a time as emitters land — produces churn without catching anything: what actually
// guards against unused work here are the uniqueness assertions and `spec-stats --verify`.
#![allow(dead_code)]

/// `return Err(format!(...))`, for the many places where the useful thing to do with a
/// broken spec is stop and explain.
