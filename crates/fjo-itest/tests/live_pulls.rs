//! Pull requests, against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! The pull request group is the one where a `FakeTransport` test proves the least. Almost
//! everything here is a *relationship between two server-side facts* that a mock decides for
//! itself: a review is refused unless somebody other than the author files it, a review request is
//! refused unless the named account can already see the repository, `refs/pull/<n>/head` exists
//! only because the server publishes it, a scheduled auto-merge is invisible except in what a
//! second cancel answers, and "this repository runs no CI" arrives as a shape
//! (`{"state":"","statuses":null}`) that nobody would think to write into a fixture.
//!
//! Deliberately not repeated here: `porcelain.rs` already covers `pr create --fill`,
//! `pr merge --squash -d`, and the machine-output path of `pr view`/`pr status`; `agit.rs` covers
//! the AGit flow end to end. This file picks up where those stop — reviews, review comments,
//! requested reviewers, files and diffs, the edit/close/reopen lifecycle, branch updates, and the
//! merge pre-checks.

///
/// ```json
/// {"state":"","sha":"","total_count":0,"statuses":null}

///
/// Three traps in one object. `statuses` is `null` rather than `[]`, so a non-tolerant decode
/// fails. `state` is the empty string, which is **not** a member of the specification's
/// `CommitStatusState` enum, so a strict enum decode fails — this build passes it through and says
/// so as a compatibility note. And a verdict read from `state` rather than from the statuses list
/// would have no arm to take. Exit 8 (pending) or exit 1 (failed) here would both be wrong, and
/// both are what a naive implementation produces.
