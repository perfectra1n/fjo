//! Repository contents, git plumbing, releases, wikis, webhooks, deploy keys and git hooks,
//! driven against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! # Why this file exists rather than more mock tests
//!
//! Three classes of defect live here and none of them is reachable with a `FakeTransport`:
//!
//! * **Path encoding.** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{filepath}` is called with values
//!   like `src/deep/nested/main.rs`. `forgejo_client::meta_types::PathEncoding` exists solely
//!   to keep that `/` unencoded, and its doc comment says why: `src%2Fmain.rs` is a 404 for
//!   every nested file in every repository. A mock answers whatever URL it is handed, so it
//!   confirms the encoder agrees with itself. Only a server can say the URL was right.
//! * **Semantics the specification does not state.** `GET /commits/{sha}/pull` reads as "the
//!   pull request for this commit"; the server means "the pull request this *merge commit*
//!   closed", and answers 404 for the head commit of an open one. The spec says neither.
//! * **Whether an operation is reachable at all.** The git-hook endpoints are behind
//!   `DISABLE_GIT_HOOKS`, which Forgejo ships switched on. A mock would show four working
//!   commands; the server shows four 403s.
//!
//! # Byte-producing operations
//!
//! `repoGetArchive`, `repoGetRawFile` and `repoGetRawFileOrLFS` are `Produces::Bytes`: streamed,
//! and refused to a terminal without `--output` (`fjo::output::guard_binary`). The refusal is
//! keyed on the response's media type *and* on there being a terminal, so a test asserting it
//! has to ask for one with `FJO_FORCE_TTY` — under plain `cargo test` stdout is a pipe and
//! nothing is refused.
