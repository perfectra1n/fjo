//! Issues, comments, labels, milestones, reactions, attachments, tracked time and stopwatches,
//! driven end to end against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! # Why these lifecycles cannot be mocked
//!
//! Every test here is a *round trip*: a `fjo` command writes, and the result is read back out of
//! band with `curl`. That second half is the whole point. A `FakeTransport` test decides for
//! itself what the server returns, so it proves the request matched our reading of the
//! specification and nothing about whether Forgejo agrees. The failures that only show up here
//! are the ones where both sides are individually plausible:
//!
//! * a body field serialised under the wrong wire name, which the server ignores and answers
//!   `200` to anyway (`issueReplaceLabels` sending `label` for `labels` would look identical);
//! * a path built from the wrong id *kind* — `/issues/{index}` and `/issues/comments/{id}` both
//!   take a bare integer, so `42` addresses a real object either way and a mix-up never 404s;
//! * a `multipart/form-data` body that is subtly malformed but still uploads *something*.
//!
//! So attachments are compared byte for byte after the round trip, reactions are exercised on
//! both collections in the same test with deliberately non-equal ids, and nothing is believed
//! because a command exited 0.
