//! Pagination against a real server.
//!
//! Every termination rule in `forgejo-core::http::paginate` keys off response headers that the
//! Forgejo specification **does not declare** — so a unit test can only confirm that we agree
//! with our own guess about them. These tests confirm the guess.
//!
//! The rule under the most pressure is (c): "a short page ends the walk" is wrong, because
//! Forgejo silently clamps `limit` to `max_response_items`. Ask for 100, receive 50, conclude
//! "done", and lose everything past item 50 — with exit 0 and no warning. That is the highest
//! consequence silent bug available in this tool, so it gets a test against the real clamp
