//! Harness for tests that run against a real Forgejo.
//!
//! Unit tests elsewhere use `FakeTransport` and are hermetic. These tests exist for the one
//! thing mocks structurally cannot prove: **that the server agrees with the specification we
//! generated from**. A mock will happily confirm our own misreading of the spec.
//!
//! Two modes:
//!
//! - `FJO_TEST_HOST` + `FJO_TEST_TOKEN` set — run against that instance. Fast, and useful
//!   for pointing at a real server you control.
//! - Otherwise — boot a throwaway container, bootstrap an admin and a token, and tear it down.
//!
//! Tests skip (rather than fail) when neither is available, so `cargo test --workspace` works
//! on a machine without Docker.

// This crate is `publish = false`, so its rustdoc exists for contributors, who read it with
// `--document-private-items`. Module docs here deliberately link to the private helpers they
// describe — that is the useful thing to link to when explaining how a module works — and those
// links resolve under that flag. Suppressing the lint keeps the links navigable rather than
// demoting sixteen of them to inert code spans. The published crates (forgejo-core, -model,
// -client) do NOT carry this allow: docs.rs renders no private items, so there a link to one is
// genuinely broken for the only audience that sees it.

    /// `ROOT_URL` is what Forgejo builds `clone_url`, `html_url` and `ssh_url` out of, it is
