//! The HTTP client every generated method calls into.
//!
//! # Shape of the layer
//!
//! [`Request`] describes an API call in the API's own vocabulary — a path relative to
//! `/api/v1`, an *ordered* query list, a body, an `Accept`. [`Client`] turns that into a wire
//! request exactly once — in one private `prepare` — sends it through a [`Transport`] with retry,
//! and offers seven typed exits: [`Client::json`], [`Client::value`], [`Client::empty`],
//! [`Client::raw`], [`Client::bytes`], [`Client::items`], and [`Client::capabilities`].
//!
//! Everything polymorphic lives here. Generated code is concrete: `async fn
//! create_pull_request(&self, owner: &str, repo: &str, body: &CreatePullRequestOption) ->
//! Result<PullRequest>` and nothing more. With 506 operations, an `impl Serialize` parameter or a
//! `T: DeserializeOwned` return would monomorphise per operation *and* per call site, making
//! compile time superlinear in generated volume.
//!
//! # Why `query` is a `Vec`
//!
//! Repeated query keys are legal and load-bearing in this API: `?labels=bug&labels=ci` filters
//! on both labels, and `?state=open&state=closed` is a real request. A `HashMap<String, String>`
//! — the obvious choice — silently keeps one of them. It is also unordered, which makes request
//! URLs non-deterministic and snapshot tests flaky. So: an ordered `Vec<(Cow<str>, String)>`,
//! with [`Request::set_query`] for the rarer "replace this key" case.
