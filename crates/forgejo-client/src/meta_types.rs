//! The metadata vocabulary that drives layer 2 — every one of the 506 operations as a
//! command — plus `--json` field discovery.
//!
//! # Why this is data and not types
//!
//! The obvious way to expose 506 operations as CLI commands is 506 `#[derive(clap::Args)]`
//! structs. That does not work here, for one disqualifying reason: clap's derive path builds
//! the *entire* command tree eagerly inside `Parser::parse()`. With ~3,000 flags across 506
//! subcommands, that is thousands of `Arg` constructions, with their allocations, on **every
//! invocation — including `fjo --version`**. Five to twenty milliseconds spent building a
//! parser the user will never reach, in a tool whose whole pre-network budget should be under
//! twenty. The derive approach also costs minutes of compile time and megabytes of binary.
//!
//! So the generator emits these `const` tables instead. They are data, not generics: they
//! compile in seconds and land in `.rodata`. `fjo-raw` then peeks at `argv`, and builds
//! `clap::Command` objects at runtime for **only the subtree the user actually named** — ten
//! group stubs for `fjo raw --help`, one full command for `fjo raw repo create-pull-request`.
//!
//! Everything here is `&'static` for that reason. Nothing in this module allocates.
